  <h1>lifesteal</h1>
  <p>A friend asked me to make a lifesteal plugin in less than 5 days, which is what I did.</p>
</div>
<br/>
Also, because I hate myself I will point out the flaws:
<br/>

1. Resource Pack isn't a part of the plugin (owners would need to make their own pack :/)
2. Revive Beacon items don't have a styled name (this is because I use the item name and not an item tag)
3. ยง codes are used instead of Components (I was just lazy)
4. /ban commands are used instead of using the BanList (couldn't get it to work)
   

Basically, please **don't** use this plugin unless you want a plugin that has NOTHING else other than the core lifesteal gameplay.
<br/>
By the way did I mention there's also a /kms command?
